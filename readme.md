# Enhanced ZSH Configuration

A powerful and modular ZSH configuration setup focused on productivity and user experience. Works seamlessly across both desktop and server environments.

## ‚ú® Features

- Fast and responsive shell experience with Starship and Znap
- Comprehensive plugin management using Znap
- Intelligent command completion system
- History management with duplicate prevention
- Package management utilities for Arch Linux systems
- Command suggestion and syntax highlighting
- Directory bookmarking and quick navigation
- Rust development environment support

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install required packages
# For Arch Linux
pacman -S zsh git curl

# For Debian/Ubuntu
apt install zsh git curl

# For RHEL/CentOS
dnf install zsh git curl
```

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pakrohk-DotFiles/zsh-config.git ~/.zsh_config
```

2. Create a single symbolic link for the main ZSH configuration file:
```bash
ln -sf ~/.zsh_config/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

3. Set ZSH as your default shell:
```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Now, restart your terminal. The first time you launch ZSH, `znap` and `starship` will be automatically installed. All other configuration files are sourced directly from `~/.zsh_config`, keeping your home directory clean.

## üîß Configuration Structure

```
~/.zsh_config/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .zshrc           # Main config file (symlinked to ~/.zshrc)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .zshrc.local     # Local/machine-specific settings (sourced by .zshrc)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prompt.local    # Starship prompt setup (sourced by .zshrc)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .zsh_aliases     # Custom aliases and functions (sourced by .zshrc)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .paru_fzf.zsh    # Package management utilities (sourced by .zshrc)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .zfunc/          # Directory for custom completion functions
```

### Main Components

- **Base Configuration** (.zshrc)
  - The only file that needs to be symlinked to your home directory.
  - Sets shell options, history, and key bindings.
  - Initializes the plugin manager and sources all other configuration files from `~/.zsh_config`.

- **Prompt Configuration** (.prompt.local)
  - Ensures Starship is installed
  - Initializes the Starship prompt
  - Creates a default `starship.toml` if none exists

- **Local Configuration** (.zshrc.local)
  - Machine-specific environment variables and settings
  - Can be used to override default settings

- **Aliases and Functions** (.zsh_aliases)
  - Contains shortcuts, system maintenance functions, and navigation helpers

- **Package Management** (.paru_fzf.zsh)
  - Interactive package management interface
  - Fuzzy search capabilities
  - System maintenance utilities

## üîå Included Plugins

- `fast-syntax-highlighting`: Real-time command syntax highlighting
- `zsh-autosuggestions`: Fish-like command suggestions
- `zsh-completions`: Additional completion definitions
- `z`: Quick directory jumping
- `wd`: Directory bookmarking
- `git`: Enhanced Git integration
- `colored-man-pages`: Colorized man pages
- `virtualenvwrapper`: Python virtual environment management
- `alias-tips`: Reminds you when you forget to use an alias
- `zcolors`: Provides colorized `ls` output

## üì¶ Package Management Features

Access package management utilities by running the `pf` command. This provides an interactive `fzf`-based menu for the following actions:

- **Search and install packages**: Search for packages from the official repositories and the AUR. The search is now more powerful and supports multiple keywords (e.g., a search for `linux zen` will find `linux-zen`).
- **Remove packages**: Select one or more installed packages to remove.
- **Clean orphaned packages**: Find and remove packages that are no longer required by any other package.
- **List explicit packages**: View and manage packages that you have explicitly installed.
- **List foreign (AUR) packages**: View and manage packages installed from the AUR or local files.

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading of completions
- Instant prompt configuration
- Efficient plugin management with Znap
- Optimized completion system

## üîê SSH Agent Management

The configuration automatically manages an `ssh-agent` instance for you:
- The agent is started on your first ZSH session.
- The agent's environment is saved and reused across all subsequent shell sessions.
- It automatically loads your `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` key, so you only need to enter your passphrase once.

## üõ† Customization

1. **Local Settings**: Machine-specific configurations can be added to `.zshrc.local`.
2. **Aliases**: Additional aliases and functions can be defined in `.zsh_aliases`.
3. **Prompt**: The Starship prompt can be configured by editing `~/.config/starship.toml`. If this file doesn't exist, it will be created with a default configuration the first time you start ZSH. You can learn more about configuring Starship in the [official documentation](https://starship.rs/config/).

## üîç Useful Commands & Aliases

### Functions

- `cdf`: Fuzzy search for a subdirectory and `cd` into it.
- `up <n>`: Go up `n` parent directories.
- `extract <file>`: Extract common archive types.
- `cheat <cmd> <term>`: Search the man page of `<cmd>` for `<term>`.
- `AReboot`: Restart the Pipewire audio system.

## üíª Server-Specific Considerations

For server environments:
- The Starship prompt automatically adjusts for non-GUI environments
- Package management features work with basic package managers
- Performance optimizations help with remote connections
- No GUI-dependent features are required
